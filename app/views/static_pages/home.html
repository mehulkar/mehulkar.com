<p>Hello. I'm a full stack developer at <a href="//mochaleaf.com">MochaLeaf, Inc</a> in San Francisco. I'm a product of an <a href="//devbootcamp.com">intensive crash course</a> on software development. I went to school in <a href="//uww.edu">Wisconsin</a> for Finance, but never pursued a career in the industry. I used to be a professional tennis instructor and high school coach. In addition to my full time job, I'm working on building <a href="//collegedesis.com">a community</a> of South Asian student organizations.</p>
<p>The best place to get in touch with me is through <a href="//twitter.com/mehulkar">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I also <a href="/posts">blog</a> sometimes.</p>
