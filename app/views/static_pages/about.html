  Hello. I'm currently a full stack developer at <a href="//mochaleaf.com">MochaLeaf, Inc</a> in San Francisco. I'm a product of an <a href="//devbootcamp.com">intensive crash course</a> on software development. I went to school in <a href="//uww.edu">Wisconsin</a> for Finance, but never pursued a career in the industry. I used to be a professional tennis instructor and high school coach. In addition to my full time job, I'm working on <a href="//collegedesis.com">CollegeDesis</a>. The best place to get in touch with me is through <a href="//twitter.com/mehulkar">twitter</a>.
