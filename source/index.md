## About Me

I currently earn a living writing code, but I also teach tennis. In the past
I've worked as a market researcher, washed dishes and pruned trees.

In college I started (and sold) a company that generated cash by
renting appliances to facilitate international microloans to
Third World entrepreneurs.

I also created and grew a <a href="//collegedesis.com">community of
South Asian student organizations</a> for 3 years.

I have a degree in Finance, but I've forgotten most of what I learned.
Some of the more valuable parts of my education come from the 8 years
I spent at the [Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment][2].
