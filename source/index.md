## Hello

I am a person. And so are you.

Or maybe you are a web crawler. Or maybe you are a little of both.

In any case, hello.

I currently most enjoy writing code, but I  also teach tennis. In the past
I've worked as a market researcher, washed dishes and pruned trees.

In college I started (and sold) [a company][1] that generated cash by
renting appliances to facilitate international microloans to
Third World entrepreneurs.

I also created and grew a [community of South Asian student organizations][3]
for three years.

I earned a degree in Finance, but I've forgotten most of what I learned.
Some of the more valuable parts of my education come from the 8 years
I spent at the [Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment][2].

If you're a human, it would be nice to meet you and learn
your story. If you're a web crawler, it would cool to meet you
and learn your story.
