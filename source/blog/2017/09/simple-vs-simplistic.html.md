title: Simple Vs. Simplistic

Sometimes, I hear myself (and others) provide a "simple" explanation of a topic.
I think describing something as "simple" subtly excludes those who do _not_ find
the topic simple. At the very least, this includes everyone who is new to the
topic. This can be counter-productive, because the reason for providing "simple"
explanations to a topic is usually to introduce the topic to newcomers!

Instead, I think that introducing a topic with a "simplistic" explanation is
not only more accurate, it is a friendlier way of signaling that the explanation
is for beginners. "Simple" implies that the topic should be simple to the
audience. "Simplistic" implies that the topic is complex.

I prefer the latter.
