## prep
- Made 1/2 sizes of https://www.marthastewart.com/344840/soft-and-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies
- Forgot to 1/2 the salt amount, so used full 1tsp
- oiled pan with olive oil (lightly and spread with brush) instead of parchment paper
- Took out of oven at 16 mins, still too soft, put back in for 3 more mins
- Took out at total 19 mins (+time they were out at min 16 for checking)

## baker notes

- Feel too soft (poking with spatula)
- browning on sides, but middle is soft
- olive oil could be cause of too soft
- color is too light, look under cooked

## taster notes
- choco chips didn't melt all the way through (maybe need better quality ingredient?)
    - chef note: try chocolate chunks instead
- cookies too white, why no brown?
    - chef note: maybe sugar wasn't brown sugar? or maybe on wrong rack in oven for browning?
