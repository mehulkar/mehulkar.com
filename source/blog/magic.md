> It’s interesting that many of the things that I mentioned as disadvantages, I now consider advantages. To be fair, there is no “magic” in Python, if you dive in a little deeper, you’ll find out that there is no actual magic involved, it’s just the way the language interprets your code, and from that perspective, I find it fascinating. If you share the same feelings, I suggest you to investigate further about how the language works, if something seems like “magic”, find out what’s actually happening, things will become a lot clearer and that “magic” will turn into “convenience”.

I often have to remind myself that things that seem magical or inexplicable
are always revealable. Only the amount of time and effort to reveal their
mysteries is variable.
