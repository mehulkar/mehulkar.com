I recently watched all 7 seasons of West Wing on Netflix and now I'm intrigued by politics.

1. I don't think I have all the context to understand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPsr1RnEfWo">Maine Us Se Ye Kaha</a>, but it's beautiful poetry (<a href="https://qausain.wordpress.com/2009/11/07/musheer/">translation</a>), and I love that Laal uses music to express meaning and not just rhythm and melody.
1. In the Western music, you can't get more political than hip hop. Lupe Fiasco was one of the first artists who made me appreciate that and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22l1sf5JZD0">Words I Never Said</a>, provocative as it is, is probably the most prime example of that.
1. More contemporarily, Raghu Dixit's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acq_ugE_XUI">Jag Changa</a> says it all in that last line "<em>Jaag Waqat se pehle bande" (</em>Wake up before it's too late).

Anyway, the point of this week wasn't politics, as such, but I'm looking for artists who are storytellers before they are musicians. Know of any?

Happy Friday!
