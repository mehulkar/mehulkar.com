 <div>I recently watched all 7 seasons of West Wing on Netflix and now I'm intrigued by politics. <br>

	<li style="margin-bottom:10px">I don't think I have all the context to understand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPsr1RnEfWo">Maine Us Se Ye Kaha</a>, but it's beautiful poetry<span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;"> (</span><a href="https://qausain.wordpress.com/2009/11/07/musheer/" style="font-style: normal; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; height: inherit;">translation</a><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; line-height: 24px;">)</span>, and I love that Laal uses music to express meaning and not just rhythm and melody. </li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:10px">In the Western music, you can't get more political than hip hop. Lupe Fiasco was one of the first artists who made me appreciate that and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22l1sf5JZD0">Words I Never Said</a>, provocative as it is, is probably the most prime example of that.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:10px">More contemporarily, Raghu Dixit's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acq_ugE_XUI">Jag Changa</a> says it all in that last line "<em>Jaag Waqat se pehle bande" (</em>Wake up before it's too late).</li>
</ol>
Anyway, the point of this week wasn't politics, as such, but I'm looking for artists who are storytellers before they are musicians. Know of any?<br>
<br>
Happy Friday!<br>
