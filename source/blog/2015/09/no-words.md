I've been having trouble sleeping. My mother would say it's because I look at a computer screen all day. She's probably right.

1. [Alone in Kyoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUjAtYQkFm8) isn't quite elevator music, but it doesn't grab my attention either. It lets me just...wander.
1. I have no idea if [this Ludovico Einaudi piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNg3qHdEcY) is considered good compositionally, but it plays like a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
1. Lastly, I know Usman Riaz is old news, but [Firefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2WBY2HRDg) is still cinematic and amazing.

What are you listening to this week?

P.S. Thank you to everyone who asked why I missed last week :D
