<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUjAtYQkFm8">Alone in Kyoto</a> isn't quite elevator music, but it doesn't grab my attention either. It lets me just...wander.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:15px">I have no idea if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fNg3qHdEcY">this Ludovico Einaudi piece</a> is considered good compositionally, but it plays like a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:15px">Lastly, I know Usman Riaz is old news, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2WBY2HRDg">Firefly</a> is still cinematic and amazing.</li>
