Some pretty historic things happened in the last week. This weeks musics are about ideas that convey grand, but visceral messages.

1. Bree Newsome climbed up a pole and took down the Confederate flag in South Carolina and got arrested for it. Turns out she published a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breenewsome/staystrong">Love Song to Freedom Fighters</a> a few months ago.
1. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage. My favorite comment on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXo9Fra5ew">this Greg Holden song</a> is: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDXo9Fra5ew" target="_blank"><img class="tl-email-image" data-id="286445" height="129" src="https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/2b9ddbe5bcd443ed550266ef508a378df7927a70/images/7b5c6c0d-694f-403c-b1d4-081d016f8a2d.png" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"></a> Also, I like Greg Holden's voice.
1. The poetry of the phrase "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZc2ylAwRf8">we are nowhere and it's now</a>" makes me think every time. These historic, remarkable things from this week arbitrarily mark the passage of eternity. Just like this moment you're in right now.
