1. Coke Studio is one of the most remarkable things in my music world and it has been for years. Javed Bashir's traditional folk qawwali and that lute (I think it's a lute?) in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDgeABMDuiU">Yaad</a> are just amazing. Also, people like to demonize modern pop for being simplistic for the sake of being catchy (i.e. memorable). But I could say the same about traditional qawwalis and bhajans.
1. I found this amazing UK band that specializes in Swing. This cover of Lorde's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWKBzt-v8w4">Royals</a> is one of the most classic, white things I've seen or heard. It's great.
1. And lastly, according to the first comment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j_9a1SgHQI">this Game of Thrones cover</a> on a Sitar is "really thrilling and cosmic". It's a pretty accurate review, I think.
