	<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Amir Khan (allegedly) cried after watching the Bollywood movie Bajrangi Bhaijaan. That sentence may not mean anything to you, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwrCYAIdkeM" style="font-size: 16px;">Zindagi Kuch To Bata</a> is grand and picturesque and may induce tears. If Bollywood does one thing well, it's grand and picturesque. I absolutely love that minor chord turn from 0:25-0:30.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Swedish-American Jacqueline Mapei Cummings (better known as Mapei) came out with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPo7iNKoCGQ">Don't Wait</a> a couple years ago and it has this great simple groove with a chorus. It's heavily produced and wonderful. Mapei also has an album called <em>The Cocoa Butter Diaries</em>. I'll leave it at that.</li>

<span style="font-size: 16px;">It's crazy to think that this authentic,</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Punjabi <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epyzNyB6gF8">folk track </a></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epyzNyB6gF8" style="font-size: 16px;">from Noor Jehan</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> from 40 years was just as commercial and successful as the Punjabi rap beats on TV and at clubs today. I have to say it's just as catchy.</span>
