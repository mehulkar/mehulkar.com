 Happy Friday!<br>
<br>
I've been listening to a lot of Christian Rock on the radio. None of today's musics are Christian Rock though. Maybe next week :D
<ol>
	<li>Three high school students were injured at the same time and I'm kind of glad they were. Those harmonies are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1UMO_PkFY">Classic</a>. Also, I like the theme of three.</li>
	<li>Richa Sharma stops in random village and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=549NbfKeiq4">impromptu folk musics</a> with random village people. </li>
	<li>And a creepy "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYEC4TZsy-Y">Perfect Day</a>" from Tanya. Double emphasis on the air quotes and the creepy.</li>
</ol>
- Mehul :)<br>
