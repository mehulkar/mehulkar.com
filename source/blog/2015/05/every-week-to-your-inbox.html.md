 Happy Friday!<br>
<br>
David introduced me to King Charles last week. I love the folksy-Mumford-and-sons feel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN_cOsjErDE">Love lust</a>. But then wait for it to turn all punk rock. Pretty. darn. repeatable.<br>
<br>
I never really got into Papon's non-Hindi music, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiWip1JzDI8">Boitha Maro</a> has been stuck in my head for a few days now. I don't even know what language it's in. I think Assamese? The parent album of this song actually won an award and has a bunch of other great tracks as well. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1JB1IZHtuE">The Journey Song</a> from Piku came out and it's a fine song. I definitely like it. But I don't like it enough to share it here. EXCEPT that it marks the introduction of Anupam Roy (the composer) to mainstream Bollywood. Anupam Roy has been a big deal in Bengali music for a while, so I'm really excited for fresh blood in mainstream. <br>
