 <div>Ben E. King died last week. I didn't really know much of him or his music, but Stand By Me has been one of my all-time classic favorites for a long time and I wanted this week to be three covers of that track.

But then I announced ThreeMusics publicly and amidst discovering random music and people sending me more, I couldn't dedicate all three of today's selections to Mr. King, so I cut it down to just one cover. From there it's an ad-hoc list--which was always the intention for this weekly. </div>

<ol>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlZxx3elxBE">Tracy Chapman's cover</a> of Stand By Me is probably my favorite, because I love Tracy Chapman. </li>
	<li>When the Nooran sisters casually belt out <a href="https://youtu.be/IfrrIYjKwDU?t=46s">Patakha Guddi</a>, I hear years of discipline and dedication.</li>
	<li>A friend/subscriber from the test run last week sent me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k7ueRrKRmo">this Vampire Weekend ditty</a> and I weirdly like it. I wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it, but I still like it every time.</li>
