 I didn't really listen to much music this week. But I've had some tunes stuck in my head that I wanted to share.
<ol>
	<li>Heard Nikhil Desouza's: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nikhildsouza/how-do-i-make-you-feel-good">How Do I Make You Feel Good</a> last night. Innocent, simple, campfire music. Just my kind of track. </li>
	<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ783EHQkng">Moongil Thottam</a> is a Tamil track by A.R. Rehman (so that automatically makes it worth listening to). The lyrics translate to something fairly generic as far as Indian music goes (although the poetry of a language I don't speak is probably lost on me), but I still like it. </li>
	<li>Someone off this list sent me this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/princefoxmusic/raindrops-feat-kerli-prince-fox-remix">Prince Fox remix of SNBRN's Raindrops</a> that I really like for work music. I don't see it as a standalone track, but I think it would be great for a longer playlist with similar stuff. </li>
</ol>
