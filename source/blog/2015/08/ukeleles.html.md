Oy!

1. I wonder why every song with a ukelele is worth listening to...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8YCSJpF4g4">this Noah and The Whales track</a>--more like a ditty--is weirdly nostalgic, even though it's about the future.
1. I don't know if they're still in business or not, but every once in a while I get an automated email from thesixtyone.com thanking me for helping get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttH4Rd8djPM">Robots in Love</a> to the home page. I guess I really liked this song in 2011?
1. And now for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb9qjvoJ1t8">your monthly dose of Papon</a>.

Happy Friday!
