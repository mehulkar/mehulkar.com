<span style="font-size: 16px;">Feeling Good is one of the greatest songs of all time. Mostly it carries itself, but Lauryn Hill letting loose in </span><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-lauryn-hills-show-stopping-feeling-good-on-tonight-show-20150731">this latest Nina Simone tribute</a><span style="font-size: 16px;"> makes me want to punch a wall.</span>

	<li style="margin-bottom:10px">I absolutely love live studio recordings. Google says <strong>Dodo Crew</strong> is a "Waste Management Service", but the live recording of their original track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn5gTkQpDn8">Yengo Yen Manam</a> is so acoustic and so beautiful.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt251NpJk7I">Gemini Vibe</a> is the definition of artistry. A collaboration between musicians, tap dancers, and hip hop in some grungy underground venue in LA? <strong>Yes, please</strong>.</li>
