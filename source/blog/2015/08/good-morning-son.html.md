<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-4HrW_kxvk">Son. I am a bird. Wearing a brown polyester shirt. Do you want a coke?</a> This has been one of my favorite songs for a long time. It's about growing up and how terrible a tragedy that is. Also the lyrics are ridiculous. </li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">I swear, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9OAmRgae-U">new Sanjay K song</a> could have been on the Titanic soundtrack.  You don't have to agree with me. </li>
