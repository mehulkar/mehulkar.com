Happy Friday!

1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djAtu7mnFV4">Pagla Khabi Ki</a> is One. Catchy. Bengali. Number.
1. Jeffrey Iqbal does <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JomyGeorgeMusic/videos/924588590897906/">a pretty great <em>desi </em>ripoff</a> of Jimmy Fallon's sessions with The Roots and their toy instruments
1. Elle King's voice in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9OvgrxaPKU">Ex's and Oh's</a> has that same raspiness as Amy Winehouse, except sassier.
