 Rohan Kymal has this crazy scientist look that makes his rendition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDnXNOIZ7EU">Crazy</a> so much more appropriate. Mashing it up with A.R Rahman's Khalbali and that "Ziddiiiiii" hook is just yes.<br>
<br>
Anyone heard of Alex Boye? He takes Western pop songs and makes them African. Kind of like how many cultures take their music and add in Western elements. Ironically, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D68cUzqcTrg">Circle of Life</a>, a Western interpretation of African culture, is one of my favorites.<br>
<br>
Lastly. Some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8xmSlMb1dg">dude plays a public piano</a>.<br>
<br>
Happy Friday!<br>
