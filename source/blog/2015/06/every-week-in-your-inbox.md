I highly recommend going to open mic nights and sitting in a corner with a cup of tea.

1. Shilong Chamber Choir with the quintessential <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq7aa54xoCE">Dil Hai Chhota Sa</a>. Apparently SCC won India's Got Talent in 2010, but I just discovered them 2 days ago.
1. I heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERKmejx6J3Y">Devil's Southern Soul</a> at an open mic night and am instantly captivated by the bluegrass. Is there a word for nostalgia of traveling bards from a Middle Earth that I've only read about in fantasy novels?
1. My favorite part of <a href="https://erinbower.bandcamp.com/track/shadow-song">Shadow Song</a> is Erin Bower's quote on her website: "I know these are not earth-shattering contributions, but they are mine, and I'm doing it"
