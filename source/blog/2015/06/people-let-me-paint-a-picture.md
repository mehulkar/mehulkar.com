Like I said a couple weeks ago, I've been listening to a lot of Christian Rock. I'm not Christian, but there's some great, uplifting music on that station.

1. Roll your windows down and drive down a highway with Matthew West's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_RjndG0IX8">Do Something</a>".
1. Just then when I said I'm not Christian, I was reminded me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD-peoN2APU">an old Talib Kweli favorite</a>. People let me paint a picture.
1. But if we're talking devotion, there's something to be said about Sufi Rock. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUcaCYx0kzI">Hor vi neevan ho</a>" goes from soft to raging and Noori's vocal range and control is mind boggling.

What have you been listening to this week?
