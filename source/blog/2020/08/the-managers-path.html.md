I finally finished [The Manager's Path][1] and highly recommend it for engineers
at all levels. Camille walks through the skills that make engineering leaders
valuable, the challenges they face, and practical advice on how to tackle tricky
situations. I am not a manager, and never have been, but reading this booked helped
me understand and appreciate the strengths of my current and previous managers;
discredit some of my frustrations as shortsighted or one-sided, and validate others
as real concerns; and most importantly, it helped me identify specific areas of
improvement for myself.

Some choice highlights that spoke to me:

> Process czars struggle when they fail to realize that most people are not as
good at following processes as they are.

I have fallen into this trap over and over again over the course of career. I like
structure and I'm good at following it. I like writing a script and following it
because it relieves me of the mental burdern of revisiting and overthinking
decisions -- and I am very bad at making decisions. But I've tried and failed
to scale this methodology time and again, because I keep forgetting that _my_
scripts reflect the way _my_ mind works, and not necessarily others. My learning
struggle now is to identify problems and how to solve them with process, rather
than starting with the process and imposing on others.

> if you can’t communicate and listen to what other people are saying, your career
growth from this point on will suffer.

I used to brush over the "technology is about communication" adage. It's not that
I didn't agree, but I didn't have too much personal experience with situations
where bad communication caused _real_ bugs or missed deadlines. In the past few
years, I've come across these situations enough times to start paying attention.
I now also _deeply_ understand how important and hard it is to hire for these
skills and how we (1) don't do it at all, and (2) when we do, we look for all
the wrong signals.

> It’s natural to feel some longing for simpler times, when it was just you and
your computer and you didn’t have to deal with all these messy, complicated humans.

I don't really yearn for working alone, but I do yearn for working in less
messy people situations. I liked that Camille acknowledges things like this
and doesn't try to brush over how hard humans can sometimes be. I'd say that's
what this book does best: it humanizes how software is made.

I have plenty more highlights [on Goodreads here][2]. Take a look and read the
book!
