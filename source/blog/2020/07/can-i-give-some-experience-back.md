They say that having a little bit of knowledge can be dangerous, but they didn't
say that it would be dangerous to _me_.

The annoying (and hard) thing about accumulating experience is that problems
becomes a little more solvable every day. No matter how stuck I get, there's always
that tiny string. Dangling. Waiting for me to tug on it. And I _know_ if take hold,
it'll take me a little bit further; I'll be a little bit less stuck. I know I can get
to where I want to be.

It's exhausting.

I think this is what it means to be a mid-level engineer: you have the ability to
solve most problems, but not the ability to know when or how to stop.

So that's the next frontier, I guess. Resisting the urge to do the one thing I
just became halfway good at.
