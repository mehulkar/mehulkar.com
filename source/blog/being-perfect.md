My life is an open book<br/>
except the parts that I don’t want you to see.<br/>
All of those parts are just for me and for the people who get<br/>
too close.<br/>

Because not everything I’ve done and not everything I do<br/>
Is up to the standards that you would expect out of me<br/>
Not every decision I’ve made is perfectly aligned with the way I was raised;<br/>
my beautiful education.<br/>
You know?<br/>
sometimes my choices have made my mother cry<br/>
and my friends have pointed their fingers<br/>
but even if my GPA doesn’t show it, I’m just a regular guy.<br/>
who likes to makes mistakes once in a while.<br/>
You see there’ve been plenty of times when I’ve stumbled and fallen<br/>
And not all of those times were because I didn’t have a choice<br/>
Or because I didn’t know better<br/>
It was just a decision I made<br/>
Because I didn’t want to be perfect<br/>
because<br/>

Who wants that?<br/>

My life is an open book<br/>
Except the parts I don’t want you to see.<br/>
Those parts are hidden chapters with thrown away keys<br/>
Encrypted in solitude by a code undefined.<br/>
I’ll leave them in peace so that one day when I find<br/>
them searching for memories,<br/>
I’ll learn a lesson or two…<br/>
and maybe pass it along into someone else’s book.<br/>
