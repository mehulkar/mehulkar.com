I read M.G. Siegler's post on his home screen and I thought it was
an interesting way to analyze products and extrapolate trends over time.
So here is mine:

![2016 home screen](/images/2016-home-screen.jpg)

I use a few rough metrics to determine if something goes on the home screen:

-   _frequency factor_ (how frequently I use it)
-   _immediacty factor_ (how immediately I usually need it)
-   _aspirational factor_ (how much I wish I used it)

Messages and Notes have high scores in _frequency_ **and** _immediacy_.
For example, if I need to write something down, I need the Notes app to be
available fairly quickly, so I don't forget or take too much time away from
the conversation/event that produced the note that needed writing down.

Swarm<sup>1</sup> and Soundhound have really high score in _immediacy_, but
lower scores in _frequency_, so they makes the home screen,
but not the home row.

News and Health are both apps with high _aspirational_ factors, because I want to
get in the habit of looking at them more. Podcasts is an example of an app
that was _aspirational_ last year, but over months of it staring at me in the
face, it now has a high score in _frequency_.

There are some stale apps here as well:

-   GroupMe is going away now that my family uses iMessage for our group chat.
-   Gaana will go away after my subscription ends this year; I've settled
    on Saavn as the superior app. Either ï£¿Music or Spotify will probably go away also.
-   xkcd inspired me to build daily habits, but I don't read it as often now, so
    it will probably go away.

You'll notice that the Camera app is not on the home screen, even though it scores
high on _frequency_, _immediacy_, **and** _aspiration_, but it's not on
the home screen because it's readily available from the swipe-up menu. Apps like
Mail, Facebook, and Twitter are also missing, because they're reverse aspirational;
i.e. I want to use them less.

**Footnotes**

1. Now that I know about [Pilgrim][1], Swarm might fall out of the home page
   because maybe I don't need to check in everywhere to build this map.
