A good team is made up of people who push each other to Be Betterâ„¢. I call this
interaction _nudging_. When people gently remind each other not to handle that
extra edge case or to show up on time or model good behavior, they are nudging
each other to make things better. This is an important dynamic for teams to
outperform themselves over time.

There's another dynamic that also matters: how a nudge is _received_. I call
this side of the interaction _budging_, and think it's equally important. People
who can give up control to empower others are budging to make space for others.
Teams, especially teams with strong players, often have strong opinions. This is
good, and is correlated with experience. But strong opinions are often tightly
coupled to personal egos, so it's a rare sight to see those opinions give way to
something else. This dynamic disrupts the status quo and prevents stagnation.
It's similar to how breaking up monopolistic rule can spur innovation. Allowing
others to "win" disagreements when it doesn't matter is a healthy and efficient
way to improve team health.

I think good teams are made of motivated people who are good at what they do.
But _great_ teams are made of the same people who can both lead and follow.
