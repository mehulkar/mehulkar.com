I thought #indieweb was just about having a silly
little #11ty blog, but the rabbit hole keeps getting deeper.
POSSE, ActivityPub/ActivityStream, Micropub, Webmention, Webfinger,
Pingback, Trackbacks, Fediverse, Bridgy, BridgyFed, RSS, it jus
keeps going.

And for good reason. The people who've been trying
to make this happen have been trying
for a long time! E.g the [Trackback spec][1] came out 20
years ago!

It's pretty cool that people have thought
all this through already, but it's a lot to
learn if you want to participate.
