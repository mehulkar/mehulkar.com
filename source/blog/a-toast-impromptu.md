From acquaintance to friendship to a daily routine<br />
Through complications and hate cycles,<br />
Thursdays and after parties.<br />
UC hangouts, international dinners<br />
Getaway day trips and typical week nights.<br />
Intramurals and barbecues,<br />
Religious debates, walks by the lake.<br />
black hats and gowns and good bye tunes…<br />
We’ve come together.<br />
Whether or not we die in the same places<br />
I raise my glass.<br />
In celebration of these traces of memories that will be with us…<br />
Forever.<br />
