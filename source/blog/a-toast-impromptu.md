```
From acquaintance to friendship to a daily routine
Through complications and hate cycles,
Thursdays and after parties.
UC hangouts, international dinners
Getaway day trips and typical week nights.
Intramurals and barbecues,
Religious debates, walks by the lake.
black hats and gowns and good bye tunes…
We’ve come together.
Whether or not we die in the same places
I raise my glass.
In celebration of these traces of memories that will be with us…
Forever.
```
