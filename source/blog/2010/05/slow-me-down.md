A friend wrote me a handwritten letter because he doesn’t like email much.

When I opened up my mailbox that day, it was more exciting than that time when **I got email**. …Oh wait, I get dozens every day.

There’s no date on the letter, but I think I received it some time in January or February. On April 15th, I sat down to write back. I had kept putting it off because I didn’t have the patience to focus on one thing for more than a few minutes at a time.

The thought of [settling my mind](http://www.tm.org/) is daunting. Quantity and fluidity has become everything. I dodge in between subjects, flirting with them and riffling through the peripheries, but mastery and one-minded focus is no longer the motive or goal.

I had a discussion with a friend once. About specialization vs. width of experience. I wanted to use my college experience to gain exposure to take a diverse range of classes. He wanted to put all his efforts into one.

He had a good point: **The future of the job force lies in teamwork.** You don’t need to know more than one field to be part of the team.

I’d rather be the one that assembles the team. I need to know a little bit of everything to be able to do that.

I eventually finished the letter on May 1st (in two separate writings). It slowed me down when I didn’t want to slow down. But then again, [balance is key](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/core9/phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#13).
