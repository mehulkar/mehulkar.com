A ninja trains with **discipline**. Practices technique until he is flawless. Until he can reproduce the same strokes over and over again.

But then he must use this precision to be **unpredictable**.

This weekâ€™s Ninja Letter was published one day later than usual. Some of you noticed. Others did not.

When you play, save your weapons.

Allow your opponent to become comfortable with your style. Stay at 80% speed. Hit 80% as hard as you can. Serve to the backhand every time. Hit deep past the service line.

When your opponent becomes comfortable:

Drop shot.
Serve to forehand.

**Go 100%**.
