The root of pressure is **fear**.

The root of fear is indecision.

When we are unsure about what we want, we become unsure of what to do, and then unsure of what will happen.

**When we are unsure, we anticipate failure.**

We lose confidence in our ability to make decisions, and the vicious cycle continues.

A ninja does not battle pressure. He understands his fears.

Are you afraid of missing the next shot? Of not making the team? Of losing your spot in the lineup?

Donâ€™t be.

Or the pressure will never go away.
