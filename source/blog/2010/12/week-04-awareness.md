A ninja’s most important attribute is _awareness_. Even in the darkest hours a ninja knows its surroundings.

How well do you know the tennis court? What are the dimensions? How high is the net? How fast can you get from the baseline to the net? From side to side?

Some of you are born with a natural ability to know these things. Maybe not in numbers, but you know which drop shots you can run down and which ones you cannot.

To those of you: have you ever challenged that knowledge?

And to those who don’t know:

Find out. Soon.
