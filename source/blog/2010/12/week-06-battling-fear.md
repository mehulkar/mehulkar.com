The true ninja feels no fear.

Fear is powerful. But it only attacks when we allow it. We open the door to fear when we are not sure of our _purpose_.

There are two ways to battle fear.

**SPEED UP**. So you donâ€™t have the time to think and doubt. In the heat of the battle, when the opponent is feeling the pressure too, let instinct take over. Hone this instinct in practice by speeding up.

Or **SLOW DOWN**. Step to the back of the court. See the entire court and feel your pulse. You are the one in control.
