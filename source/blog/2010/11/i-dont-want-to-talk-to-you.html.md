Because chances are, you are awesome. And you have an awesome story. And you want to share them with me. And out of this will come awesome ideas.

Unfortunately, I get excited by the simplest of things. And given my inability to focus, it too easy for me to get sidetracked from the projects I already have going.

Networking is a great thing. Constructive conversations are even better. But if your psychological profile is like mine, it might be more productive to stay away from networking than to seek it out.
