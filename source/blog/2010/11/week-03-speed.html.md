The second part of good movement is speed.

Two things determine your speed. How _fast_ you are and how _quick_.

How fast a ninja can move from Point A to Point B is not important. He can hide in the shadows as long as he wants.

But in the middle of the point, **how quickly you respond** to your opponentâ€™s moves can be the difference between winning and losing, living and dying.

**Stay alert** by flexing your calves and forcing yourself to stay light on your toes. Your feet should not touch the ground for longer than a split second.
