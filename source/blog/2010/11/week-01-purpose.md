Ninjas are beautiful.

They are beautiful because they have purpose. And their every move is dedicated to that purpose.

Learn to have purpose.

Your “goal” might be to hit more winners, or to win a match. Think about these things between points.

“Purpose” is an attitude you take during the point. If you’re going to approach the net, do it as if there were no other choice. If you’re going to use an under spin backhand, don’t settle for a weak chip shot. If you’re hitting a forehand winner, drive through the ball without fear.

Do not second guess yourself.
