Usually I write in riddles and rhymes<br/>
To try to disguise what I mean<br/>
So I can<br/>
Get away with opening up and saying true things<br/>
Without feeling<br/>

…exposed…<br/>

or obscene.<br/>
I can, weave my thoughts into webs of words,<br/>
Laced in sweet honey-stick furs.<br/>
They’re a little too smooth<br/>
Uncomfortable<br/>
And so you get caught,<br/>
but it still feels good.<br/>

My rhythm and flow keeps you anticipating,<br/>
waiting to hear a simple truth<br/>
And I<br/>
keep leading you on<br/>
and on without saying it.<br/>
Ruthless.<br/>

When someday you find this letter<br/>
I’ll want you to know<br/>
in no roundabout way<br/>
I’ll want you to know<br/>
I’ll want you to know<br/>
And I’ll want you to know once more.<br/>

In the simplest of words and without intention<br/>
I’ll just want you to know:<br/>
