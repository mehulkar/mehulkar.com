<em>
I can be your scapegoat<br />
If you will be my sailboat<br />
Help me catch this tide<br />
Leave it all on the shoreside,<br />
We can be as wild or as tame as we like,<br />
Depending on the wind and the waves that we ride<br />
I know you need a reason to run out free<br />
Baby make up an excuse and call it me.<br />

I can be your alibi<br />
If you will be my fancy tie<br />
We’ll cruise the streets in limousines<br />
I’ll buy you suits and shiny pins<br />
On our own we’ll be alone<br />
Together we’d get Al Capone.<br />
I know that we’re not not really spies<br />
But girl let me be your disguise.<br />
</em>

Maybe I’ll keep adding to this. The first verse was inspired by the word scapegoat. The second verse was inspired by Chuck. It sounds better if you rap it.
