Patience is a dangerous thing. To wait until the time is right. To recognize opportunity. Sometimes this is enough. But that means letting your opponent dictate the point. And that is dangerous.

A Ninja is always in control.

For a ninja, patience is not about recognizing opportunity. **It’s about creating it.**

Create opportunity by making your opponent uncomfortable. Aim three feet inside the lines, but hit to the four corners. Maybe your opponent doesn’t like balls that bounce high, maybe it’s the low ones. Find out what makes them uncomfortable and chip away. When your opponent is uncomfortable enough…

**Finish.**
