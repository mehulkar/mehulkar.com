For most, the hardest part of the point is the finish. To finish the job. And to finish it cleanly.

**The finish is the easiest part for the ninja.**

Hitting the big shot is not the hard part. Deciding to hit the big shot is the hard part.

Big shots fail if you hold back. Ninjas have no reason to hold back. They play the entire point for the finish.

If you have mastered _pressure_ and _fear_, if you have created the right opportunity, and if you are playing with _purpose_, the finish is the easiest.

And the most enjoyable.
