Disclaimer: I really don’t know what I was thinking when I wrote this.
I can’t make sense of it now, but maybe it means something to someone
else.

```
Blind faith is evil, but necessary.
Need is a strong word, want is enough for most.
Or maybe I have it all wrong. And faith is just…
Easier.
And we really do need.

What if there’s reason
for every one and thing.
What if hope is just an excuse.

And what if we really do need.

Making things happen is hard.
Letting things go is hard.
Hard could be the new easy,

if we really did need.
```
