Disclaimer: I really don’t know what I was thinking when I wrote this.
I can’t make sense of it now, but maybe it means something to someone
else.

<em>
Blind faith is evil, but necessary.<br/>
Need is a strong word, want is enough for most.<br/>
Or maybe I have it all wrong. And faith is just…<br/>
Easier.<br/>
And we really do need.<br/>

What if there’s reason<br/>
for every one and thing.<br/>
What if hope is just an excuse.<br/>

And what if we really do need.<br/>

Making things happen is hard.<br/>
Letting things go is hard.<br/>
Hard could be the new easy,<br/>

if we really did need.<br/>
</em>
