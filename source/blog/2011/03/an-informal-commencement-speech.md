I wanted to write this speech in rhyme.<br/>

I wanted to write this speech in rhyme<br/>
So I could pretend that I was on time<br/>
To tell you these next few lines,<br/>
today.<br/>

I wanted to deliver it fast<br/>
Say the words quick but make them last<br/>
Because I know that it’s already<br/>
too late.<br/>

Most of what I’ve learned<br/>
I wish I knew four years ago<br/>
Most of what I would say<br/>
You already know.<br/>

I’m not here to inspire or to set the mood.<br/>
Not going to tell you to change your attitude<br/>
I’m here to highlight the sunset we’re walking into.<br/>
Maybe give voice to our fears, and everything we’ve been through.<br/>
To close the final curtain<br/>
And roll the red carpet out.<br/>
Do my best to describe what this is all about.<br/>

These words may not touch you, you may not remember this day<br/>
And everything I say will probably be a waste.<br/>

Because the truth is we’re done listening<br/>
And all of these words<br/>
Are falling flat on our ears<br/>
Compared to the years.<br/>
Because we’ve spent too much time with each other and ourselves<br/>
For me to preach or to teach or even<br/>
Reach your attention today.<br/>

Because today if I told you<br/>
That ‘x’ equals ‘y’, or that ‘i’ comes before ‘e’<br/>
I’d be a fool.<br/>

I stepped into this world<br/>
Hoping to discover<br/>
What I wanted from me<br/>
What I wanted from we<br/>
And to find a way that we could be<br/>
All together<br/>
In this tiny little room<br/>
Which won’t be that small soon,<br/>
when we’re gone.<br/>

We’ve spent 4 years dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s<br/>
And sometimes it’s like it was just for the fees<br/>
Like a dirty disease<br/>
“Please!<br/>
Let us learn what we need”<br/>
I would sometimes cry.<br/>
“Not because we paid<br/>
And not for the grade,<br/>
But so one day we could make a change.”<br/>

Tomorrow we’ll be real<br/>
Real people with jobs and dreams<br/>
Throw our hats in the air and let down our hair…<br/>
I’m scared.<br/>
Because tomorrow we won’t have someone else to label us<br/>
As students or toddlers or passengers on a bus<br/>
We’ll define ourselves and our lives<br/>
We’ll set goals and dig holes<br/>
We’ll be alone.<br/>
And I’m scared.<br/>

Some of us will think we’re better<br/>
Smarter or faster or stronger<br/>
Than the rest.<br/>
I’ll be one of those. I’ll think I’m the best.<br/>
But if I do what I do without you and without us, chipping away<br/>
At the end of the day, I still won’t have done much.<br/>

But instead of isolation if I seek cooperation<br/>
If I ask you what you care about and share myself<br/>
If we come to a conclusion that we reach ourselves,<br/>
Instead of being spoon fed the answers in multiple choice<br/>
Maybe we can make a difference or just have a voice.<br/>

And that’s really all it takes to be heard.<br/>

We’re all here for a reason, for most of us it’s the same<br/>
It’s a silly piece of paper that we’ll put in a frame<br/>
We’ll trick our minds into believing it’s worth it,<br/>
Tell ourselves that the exams were all part of the game<br/>
And games were meant to be won.<br/>
And we’ll get stuck in the race chasing a dollar or the next big thing.<br/>
Or even something that we believe in.<br/>

But somehow, it doesn’t make sense.<br/>
Chasing and chasing and chasing.<br/>
Like dogs after cars that don’t exist.<br/>
Resist this need. I urge you my friends.<br/>
Play the game to play and not to win.<br/>
Play the game to learn what drives you<br/>
But not to win<br/>
Play the game to figure out the things that matter.<br/>
But not to win.<br/>
Because when we win, that’s all there is.<br/>

Instead we can play and smile all the way.<br/>
Wherever we go and however we get there<br/>
It won’t be about you or even me, to be fair.<br/>
It’ll be about us. And the journey we made.<br/>
So forget about struggle, because everyone has pain.<br/>
But instead let’s ask what we can change.<br/>
What we can do from this point on that’ll make the game and the frame<br/>
all worth it.<br/>

When we flip these tassels in a minute<br/>
We’ll be for real.<br/>
Real people with values and ideals.<br/>
It’s not like we didn’t already have those, we did.<br/>
But in a couple of hours they’ll feel a little stronger,<br/>
And every moment we wait will feel a little longer.<br/>
We’ll be free to be alone.<br/>
And I’m not scared.<br/>
Even though I’m not fully prepared,<br/>
Four years were enough to make me some friends. Friends who care.<br/>
They’re all of you, I must not forget.<br/>
We might not have met, but we’re all in this room.<br/>
And that counts for something.<br/>

So to all of us here, I’ll raise a cheer<br/>
So everyone can hear, and be without fear<br/>
Because after all, we’re all in this room.<br/>
And that counts for something.<br/>

I wrote this speech in rhyme<br/>
So it would feel like there was rhythm<br/>
and music around.<br/>
Like this was a celebration of everything we’re about to do.<br/>
Because the piece of paper we’ve won doesn’t mean a whole lot, we’re not done.<br/>
We’ve just begun.<br/>
