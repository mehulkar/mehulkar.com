title: Why Product Management is Hard

The goal of a product manager is to design a roadmap
that moves the product in the desired direction
while showing incremental progress.

The difficult part of this scenario isn't designing
a roadmap--althought breaking down large endeavors
_is_ a full time job in itself.

The difficult part is balancing measurable progress
with progress in the right direction.

The key to measurable progress is incrementalism.
I don't think I need to convince anyone that breaking
down large endeavors into smaller tasks is a good thing.

But the thing about smaller tasks is this:

> Sometimes a small task looks like a step forward and
> soemtimes it looks like a step backwards.

In other words, sometimes incrementalism means introducing
complexity and friction. In even other words, sometimes
incrementalism means moving in the wrong direction<sup>1</sup>.

The problem with moving in the wrong direction is that
roadmaps can change.

For example, today our roadmap might involve getting a user's
interests from the Facebook, so we decide to add Facebook
authentication to the application even though we already have
an authentication system. This serves the purpose of measuring
progress. But if Facebook decides to remove the API we're
actually interested in (user "likes") or if our roadmap changes
so that we no longer plan to use our users' likes, then the
new authentication system becomes technical debt.

A Product Manager's role, then, is twofold:

1. To break down features into small chunks so that measurable
progress is made on a regular and frequent basis.
1. To make judgement calls about the changing nature of a roadmap
in relationship to the investments made today.

Each of these is difficult both for the technical work required
and the social work required to convince the team about the merits
of decisions.

**Footnotes**

1. By "wrong direction", I really just mean "what _seems_ like the
wrong direction".
