He said he wanted to talk. He said he was frustrated. And confused. And that he needed guidance.

**And he came to me.&nbsp;**

He said he wasn’t&nbsp;[getting better](http://mehulkar.tumblr.com/post/17259708114/the-science-of-entertainment-improvement-and-success). That he didn’t feel like he was making progress. That it seemed pointless. That he didn’t know if it was worth continuing.

I asked him if he was having fun. I asked him if there was too much pressure. I told him how I put too much pressure on myself. I said a lot of other things without thinking too much.

And he nodded and said that I had helped.

When he left, I was suddenly terrified.&nbsp;**What if he was actually listening?**

Teachers have&nbsp;[more influence than anyone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xuFnP5N2uA). And they aren’t granted that power from above. They’re granted the power from their students and and the power is based in trust. It is wonderful and significant.

But what a handsome responsibility.
