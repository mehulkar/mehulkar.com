The most brilliant part of "Born to Run‚Äù is that Douglas takes you
through his story exactly as he would run through a trail: meandering,
forgetting the purpose, and getting lost in the wonder of the trail,
instead of in anticipation of the destination.

The way Douglass weaves his story, snaking through conversation, science,
and description is like watching a discovery in slow motion as it dawns
in the eyes of a weary explorer: exhilerating. It literally brought
tears to my eyes.

Born to run is essentially a manifesto of the human condition.
It combines our modern data-driven world in search of pushing the boundaries
of evolution with the ancient mindset/arts that has traveled through history,
and, incredibly, demonstrates the existence of exactly that which the
former is missing.
