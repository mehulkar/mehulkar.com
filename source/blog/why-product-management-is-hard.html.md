The goal of a product manager is to design a roadmap
that moves the product in the desired direction
while showing incremental progress.

The difficult part of this scenario isn't designing
a roadmap--althought breaking down large endeavors
_is_ a full time job in itself.

The difficult part is balancing measurable progress
with progress in the right direction.

The key to measurable progress is incrementalism.
I don't think I need to convince anyone that breaking
down large endeavors into smaller tasks is a good thing.

But the thing about smaller tasks is that sometimes they involve
introducing complexity and friction. In even other words, sometimes
incrementalism means moving in the wrong direction<sup>1</sup>.

The problem with moving in the wrong direction is that
roadmaps can change.

For example, removing a feature for the sake of simplicity might
seem like moving backwards today. But tomorrow, the simplicity
could either be a bad thing, or a business requirement could mean
that that feature was critical and needs to come back.

A Product Manager's role, then, is twofold:

1. To break down features into small chunks so that measurable
progress is made on a regular and frequent basis.
1. To make judgement calls about the changing nature of a roadmap
in relationship to the investments made today.

Each of these is difficult both for the technical work required
and the social work required to convince stakeholders about the merits
of decisions.

**Footnotes**

1. By "wrong direction", I really just mean "what _seems_ like the
wrong direction".
