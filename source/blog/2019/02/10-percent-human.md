I wouldn't classify _10% Human_ as eye opening. Much of the advice in it included things like:
"medication has unintended side-effects" and "eat more fibre" and "the human body is more
complex than you can imagine". Thing I enjoyed the most about it is how it back explains
much of this advice and breaks it down with science. I also enjoyed how its written
very much in a "this is what we know so far" way, rather than "this is what is true" way.

Here is a decent list of highlights from my Kindle reading that should give you enough incentive
to also read the book. I definiely recommend it.

Two tangential notes:

1. I finally finished an entire book! I started this book in 2018 being extremely determined
   to finish it slowly and steadily by reading only 10 minutes per day. That got me about 60% of the
   way through the book and then it just fell by the wayside for so long that I lost my Kindle charger
   during that time. I feel really good about finally finishing. The kindle version ends at about 70%
   progress, and the rest of an index/pictures/and epilogues; that was a nice surprise.
2. At some point, I'd like to figure out a way to syndicate notes/highlights from Kindle into this
   website directly, instead of linking out. Kindle itself doesn't seem to offer a way to do this,
   but Goodreads might. And there's always scraping solutions.
