I was reading a recent [Ask HN][1] and noticed that I was immediately
not interested in companies that did anything involving analytics or more
generally, any kind of data collection. My reaction on reading the homepage
of any of these companies was usually:

> Oh great, another one of these.

I tried to explore my thoughts about this and realized that my disinterest
wasn't specifically towards analytics or data collection&mdash;I think history
is awesome and quantifying it into data points is even more awesome.

But from the standpoint of a company and its mission, this is
not exciting because data cannot exist in isolation; after all, someone
has to generate data for it to collected and analyzed. I call these analytics
and data collection companies "Auxiliary Businesses".

Auxiliary businesses exist as a layer on top of the
companies that are doing work. (I want to choose my words carefully here
because, I don't think that these auxiliary businesses are doing work that is not
worthwhile. I also don't think that they are not worth working *for*.)

But I think that once you build one layer of auxiliary business,
you can build any number of layers on top of *that* layer; i.e.
analytics for the analytics company.

I believe this is a slippery (but probably profitable) slope and
can result in the stagnation of progress in areas that deserve more attention.
