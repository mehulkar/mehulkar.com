<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>I am a human. What are you?</p>

<p>
  I write down a whole bunch of words here. They are mostly about
  <%= link_to 'programming', programming_path %>, but sometimes I also take
  notes from <%= link_to 'books', books_path %> or write bad
  <%= link_to 'poetry', poetry_path %> or jot down
  <%= link_to 'quotations', quote_path %>. Sometimes I even just write
  down <%= link_to 'things I learn', til_path %>. I've also written series like
  <%= link_to 'Play Tennis Like a Ninja', ninjatennis_path %> and
  <%= link_to 'Three Musics', threemusics_path %>.
</p>

<nav class='flex flex-wrap mb4'>
  <%= partial('partials/categories', locals: { current_categories: Post.categories.sort })%>
</nav>

<% posts_by_year = Post.by_year %>
<% current_year = Date.today.year.to_s %>
<% years = posts_by_year.map(&:first) %>

<% if !years.include? current_year %>
  <div class='mb3 mt0 ml0'>
    <h2 class='mb3'><%= Date.today.year %></h2>
    <p>
      I haven't written anything this year &#x2639;.
    </p>
  </div>
<% end %>

<%= partial 'partials/by-year', locals: { grouped_posts: posts_by_year } %>
