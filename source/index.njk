<h1>👋🏾</h1>

<p>
  I <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mehulkar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work at Vercel</a> (for now).
  I have ten years of experience working on the frontend, but I still have a lot to learn.
  The best way to see what I'm  interested in is to glance through my <a href="https://twitter.com/mehulkar/likes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter favorites</a>
  or see what I'm reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27391275-mehul" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodreads</a>.
  But you can also stay here and read what I'm thinking about. Here's a printable <a href="/resume">resume</a>.
