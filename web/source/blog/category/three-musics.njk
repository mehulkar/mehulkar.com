<p>
  Once upon a time, I started a weekly newsletter curating a list of three musics.
  I wanted to start 1:1 email conversations around music that I was currently liking
  and discover new genres from other people.

{% set posts = collections['three-musics'] | byYear %}
{% from 'partials/_by-year.njk' import render %}
{{ render(posts) }}
