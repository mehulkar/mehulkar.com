title: Today I Learned (TIL)
---

<p>I learn best by <a href="/blog/2017/02/the-5-stages-of-asking-questions">asking a lot of bad questions</a>

Anyway, here's some stuff I've learned.</p>

{% set posts = collections.til | byYear %}
{% from 'partials/_by-year.njk' import render %}
{{ render(posts) }}
