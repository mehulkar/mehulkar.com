## prep notes

- Same Recipe as [last time][1].
- Same quantity: 1/2 of all the amounts. Didn't mess up the salt this time.
- Melted butter before mixing into sugar (30s first then 60s, out of the fridge, not frozen)
  - Can't remember what I did last time, but seem to remember it was harder to mix the butter
    and sugar, so maybe it wasn't as melted? Or maybe I'm remembering something else.

## baker notes

- preheated oven too early, started before getting ingredients out
- Used ice scream scoop to put onto parchment paper (don't remember if I did that
  last time and wasn't planning to do that this time, but Amisha asked me if I was
  going to and I realized it's a great idea.)
- Oven timings
  - 10 mins in the oven
  - immediately another 5 (didn't open oven, only looking through window)
  - then open, and another 5 minutes (after < 1 min delay of being open to look)
- Cookies looked properly brown, not too white
- Thinner and bigger this time. Seems the dough spread apart more, maybe because it
  wasn't as thick as last time? (Is it possible to measure this?)

## taster notes

- Chips didn't melt all the way through again
- Not enough chips
- Dough not as good (but I liked it)
- Cookie was good mix of crispy and soft
- Couldn't tell there was salt in it
