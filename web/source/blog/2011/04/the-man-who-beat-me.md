It’s like I’m stuck waiting<br/>
for a moment that matters,<br/>
except the moment never comes<br/>
until it shatters<br/>
in my face<br/>
like I was running a race<br/>
and finished second place<br/>
and the man who beat me disappeared<br/>
without a trace.<br/>

Until I discovered that the man who won was none other than me<br/>
a version of myself that didn’t wait for opportunity<br/>
to be served on a platter<br/>
he made every decision, every action matter<br/>

Because every second you live is more special than the last<br/>
and if you don’t grab hold it’ll disappear fast<br/>
like the man who beat me to the finish line<br/>
I wish he was me, and what he had was mine.<br/>

Well…<br/>

maybe next time.<br/>
