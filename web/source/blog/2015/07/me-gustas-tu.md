Happy Friday!

1. Vishal sent me the super catchy and light-hearted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs6Y4kZ8qtw">Me Gustas Tu</a> and I think the title accurately describes how I feel about Friday :)
1. This video of Rəşid Behbudov (aka Count Dracula) singing the Indian classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaDX4WRBk1E">Saare Jahaan Se Accha</a> is ridiculous and haunting and also amazing.
1. Lastly, Naiem's first single <a href="https://soundcloud.com/naiemmusic/bliss">Bliss</a> released last week. The lyrics are kind of cheesy, but the music and production is solid. The all-male chorus with the Raginder violin does. not. disappoint.

What are you listening to this week?
