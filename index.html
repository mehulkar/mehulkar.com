<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I currently earn a living writing code, but in the past I've worked as a market researcher, a tennis instructor, and even pruned some trees.
</p>

<p>
  In college I started (and sold) a company that generated cash by renting appliances to facilitate international microloans to Third World entrepreneurs.
</p>

<p>
  I also created and grew a <a href="//collegedesis.com">community of South Asian student organizations</a> for 3 years.
</p>

<p>
  I have a degree in Finance, but I've forgotten most of what I learned. Some of the more valuable parts of my education come from the 8 years I spent at the <a href="//maharishischooliowa.org">Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment</a>.
