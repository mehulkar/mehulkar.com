<h2>About Me</h2>
<ol>
  <li><p>I currently earn a living <strong>writing code</strong>, but in the past I've worked as a market researcher, a tennis instructor, and even pruned some trees.</p></li>
  <li><p>In college I started (and sold) a company that generated cash by renting appliances to facilitate <strong>international microloans</strong> to Third World entrepreneurs.</p></li>
  <li><p>I have a <strong>degree in Finance</strong>, but I wouldn't be able to explain credit default swaps if you asked.</p></li>
  <li><p>I live in the heart of Silicon Valley, but I'm more interested in how technology is used in the developing world.</p></li>
  <li><p>Oh, and I graduated from the <strong>Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment.</strong></p></li>
